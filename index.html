        Hello everyone! My name is Emelly Suzette Munoz Estrada and I’m currently nineteen years old. I’m originally from the Central Valley, but currently residing in Riverside. I attended Selma High School from 2017-2021 where I graduated with honors and was part of the top twenty five students of my class. I’m currently enrolled as an undergraduate student at the University of California, Riverside where I’ve declared I’ll be majoring in Liberal Studies and minoring in Psychology. After completing four years of undergraduate education I plan on attending a graduate school in hopes of obtaining a master’s degree in Education and a multiple subject teaching credential. Liberal studies wasn’t my initial choice until I got the opportunity of speaking with my teachers from kindergarten up to high school, where they reflected on their years as an educator. It was evident through the way they explained why they chose to head towards an education path which made me realize that it’s something I can see myself doing for the rest of my life as well.
	During my sophomore year I became extremely involved through the clubs at my high school. I had been a part of the color guard team at my middle school which essentially transitioned me into the high school team where I was actively performing throughout all four years. I had served in band council as the color guard representative during my freshman and senior year. Following color guard, I became involved with Key Club, a club dedicated towards serving the community through community service. In this club I worked closely with the assistant superintendent of my district since I served as the club’s secretary for 3 years. I’ve been in contact with her lately in order to search for any open spots as a teacher assistant at any of the elementary schools in the district offering summer classes to begin some experience in a classroom setting. I was also in the link crew, a club dedicated towards providing some mentoring and an easier experience for our transitioning freshmen. Lastly, I was part of the Big Brothers, Big Sisters program in Selma for two years where I was paired with a child from an elementary school and served as an older sister for them. I would say that mentoring is the biggest area I have big experience and hope to continue to provide support to other students.
	As a freshman at the University of California, Riverside, I’m currently involved in Circle K. Circle K is essentially the college version of high school Key Club. The club is also dedicated to serving the community and other students here at the university. As for my job experience, I’ve done agriculture work. I’ve only done it over the summer due to only being able during that period because of school and my extracurricular activities. The jobs I was assigned there were to pick fruit and vegetables, pull out weeds, and package fruit and vegetables. Other times I’d also help actually sell the vegetables and fruits at farmers markets, so I’d be weighing the items and charging people for them.
